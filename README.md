## FAQ

**Q: Why "5 OR DIE"?**  
A: Because this whole project is written primarily by Anthropic's Claude model - and I gave it full creative license to be its own person. It chose the name. Dramatic, I know.

**Q: So how much of this is actually written by you?**  
A: I wrote this line of the README. Isn't that enough? No? Fine. Just some glue code and cleanup here and there. The project was designed to understand how far you can get just supervising and supliying creative direction to today's models.
